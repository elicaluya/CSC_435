OUTPUT FROM MyTelnetClient:
- This shows the output of using the Telnet client to try and get the dog.txt and cat.html file from the condor.depaul.edu webserver
- For some reason, I am getting a 301 response code from the server saying that the file has been permamnently moved
- I can still see the MIME header and Content-Length so I can get useful information even though I get a 301 response code.

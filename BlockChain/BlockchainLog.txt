Here is the output of running the all three processes to contribute to the block chain.
The output is mainly the same but have different timings.

** There is a bug in my program that causes the 2nd process to not contribute to block chain but only verifies blocks. I can see in the xml page that there are no creating processes that are under process 2.

Here are the startup console logs for the processses:

Process0:
Process: 0is running
Starting Block Chain Server input thread using 4930
Starting Unverified Block Server thread using 4820
Starting Public Key Server input thread using 4710

Process1:
Process: 1is running
Starting Public Key Server input thread using 4711
Starting Unverified Block Server thread using 4821
Starting Block Chain Server input thread using 4931

Process2:
Process: 2is running
Starting Public Key Server input thread using 4712
Starting Unverified Block Server thread using 4822
Starting Block Chain Server input thread using 4932





below will be part of the output in process0, process1, and process2 and you can see how they both interact by sending updated blockchains, verifying blocks, solving puzzles, and adding blocks to the block chain. You can also see how only process0 is the only one writing to the xml file:

**Keep in mind of the bug for process2 and I will only put in this txt file the parts of the console that do not show the error messages since it prints out the correct messages.

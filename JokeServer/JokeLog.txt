*** This is the output of running the primary JokeServer, Secondary JokeServer, JokeClientAdmin, and two JokeClients named Person 1 and 2
*** This output shows that the server will send the jokes and proverbs to the clients in a random order for each client
*** It also shows that the modes can be switched between PROVERB and JOKE for both the primary and secondary server with the JokeClientAdmin
*** I couldn't find a clean way to print the outputs so I individually output the files to their respective txt files using: > Log.txt for each file
*** I then copy and pasted the output into this txt file to show the chronological process of when each server is sending info, when the client receives info, when the modes are changed, and the switching between primary and secondary servers for both JokeCLientAdmin and JokeClient.
